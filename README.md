# About This Project
This project was developed for the WorldSkills Portugal NacionalChampionship and took place in November 2024.

The theme of the test was a Medieval Skillian System, and the objective was to create a CRUD for different entities, not only at the frontend level (client-side and UX/UI) but also at the backend level (server-side, with respective databases created with SQL Server), thus creating an advanced and robust full-stack application.
